# Sarcina, a new kind of package manager.

# What is Sarcina?
Sarcina is a new kind of package manager. Completely open source and web based.

# What license does Sarcina have?
Sarcina has a GNU GPLv3, this license allows you to do almost anything you want with the product except to distribute closed source versions.

# Will Sarcina be compatible with existing Cydia repositories?
As of now it is uncertain of Sarcina will use a repository system, Sarcina will not host pirated tweaks on default, but Sarcina will be open sourced and a jailbreak is all about freedom. So pirate “repos” or services will not be banned.

# How will payment be managed?
Payment will be mostly managed by the developer of the tweak, but a list of recommended payment services will be released before, when, or after Sarcina is released.

# What if I have any further questions?
Please direct all further questions to me on Twitter @tjwolf351
